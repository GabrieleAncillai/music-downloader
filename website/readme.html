<h2>Quick-Guide</h2>

<p>
    Genre: First, the cli asks you to input a genre you want to download to. The options it gives you (if it gives you any) are all the folders you have in the music directory. You can also just input a new one.
</p>
<p>
    What to download: After that it prompts you for a search. Here are a couple examples how you can search:
</p>

<pre>
&gt; #a &lt;any artist&gt;
searches for the artist &lt;any artist&gt;

&gt; #a &lt;any artist&gt; #r &lt;any releas&gt;
searches for the release &lt;album&gt; &lt;any release&gt; by the artist &lt;any artist&gt;

&gt; #r &lt;any release&gt; Me #t &lt;any track&gt;
searches for the track &lt;any track&gt; from the release &lt;any relaese&gt;
</pre>

<p>
    After searching with this syntax, it prompts you with multiple results. You can either choose one of those by inputing its id `int`, or you can search for a new query.
</p>
<p>
    After you chose either an artist, a release group, a release, or a track by its id, download it by inputting the string `ok`. My downloader will download it automatically for you.
